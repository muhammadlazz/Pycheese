### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/{your-personal-repo}/tui.editor.git
```
```sh
npm install
```
$ npm run build toastmark
$ npm run test editor
```

> TOAST UI Editor uses [npm workspace](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces/), so you need to set the environment based on [npm7](https://github.blog/2021-02-02-npm-7-is-now-generally-available/). If subversion is used, dependencies must be installed by moving direct paths per package.

### Usage

You can see your code reflected as soon as you save the code by running a server. Don't miss adding test cases and then make green rights.

#### Run snowpack-dev-server
[snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) allows you to run a development server without bundling.

``` sh
$ npm run serve editor
```

#### Run webpack-dev-server
If testing of legacy browsers is required, the development server can still be run using a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

``` sh
$ npm run serve:ie editor
```

#### Run test

``` sh
$ npm test editor
```

### Pull Request

Before uploading your PR, run test one last time to check if there are any errors. If it has no errors, commit and then push it!
